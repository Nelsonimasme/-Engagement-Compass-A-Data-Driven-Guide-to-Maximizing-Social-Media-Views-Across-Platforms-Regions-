### **Data Source**

* The dataset used in this project comes from **`nelson-1-project.social_media_trend.Vira_social_media_trend`** (BigQuery table).
* It contains structured records of **social media activity** across multiple platforms.

* **Key fields include**:

  * **Post\_Date** â€“ date of content posting
  * **Platform** â€“ social media platform (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc.)
  * **Region** â€“  location of audience engagement
  * **Content\_Type** â€“ type of content posted (Livestreams, video, Shorts, Post,Tweets etc.)
  * **Hashtags** â€“ hashtags used in the post
  * **Views, Likes, Shares, Comments** â€“ engagement metrics
  * **Engagement\_Level** â€“ classification of engagement intensity

* Data was analyzed using **SQL (BigQuery)** for extraction and aggregation, and **Tableau** for visualization and reporting.

### **Data Limitations**

While the dataset provides valuable insights, there are some limitations to consider:

1. **Data Completeness**

   * Some records were having **missing values** (e.g., incomplete hashtags, regions not specified,Date Not Specify as well).
   * Not all engagement metrics may be consistently available across platforms.

2. **Platform Representation**

   * Some platforms were having **more data points** than others, leading to possible bias in comparisons.

### **Project Objectives**

The main objective of this project is to **analyze social media engagement data** and provide actionable insights to help content creators, brands, and social media managers optimize their strategies for **maximum reach and engagement**.

Specifically, the project aims to:

1. **Identify top-performing platforms** in terms of average engagement per post.
2. **Examine content types** (e.g., Livestreams, videos, Shorts, Post e.t.c) that generate the highest views, likes, shares and Comments.
3. **Analyze regional engagement patterns** to determine where content resonates most strongly.
4. **Evaluate the impact of hashtags** on driving higher visibility and engagement.
5. **Discover time-based trends**, including months and specific days that yield higher engagement.
6. **Uncover common characteristics of top-performing posts**, such as themes, formats, or timing.
7. **Provide data-driven recommendations** for improving social media strategies across platforms.

```SQL

    -- PLATFORM WITH THE HIGHEST AVG ENGAGEMENT VIEW

SELECT Platform, 
ROUND(AVG(Views)) As Avg_Highest_views,

FROM `nelson-1-project.social_media_trend.Vira_social_media_trend` 

GROUP BY Platform
ORDER BY Avg_Highest_views DESC
