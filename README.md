### **Background**

* Social media is a **key driver of brand growth, audience reach, and engagement**.
* Success depends on **understanding audience behavior, platform dynamics, and content performance**.
* Engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, hashtags) are **critical for visibility and campaign success**.
* With huge volumes of data, a **data-driven approach** is essential to uncover trends in **platforms, regions, content types, and timing**.
* This project analyzes real data to provide **actionable insights for optimizing social media strategy**.

---

---

### **Scope of Work**

This project focuses on analyzing social media engagement data to uncover patterns and provide actionable recommendations for improving content strategy. The scope includes:

1. **Data Collection & Understanding**

   * Reviewing the provided dataset and identifying key variables (e.g., **platform, content type, views, likes, shares, Comments, hashtags, regions, dates**).

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handling missing or duplicate values.
   * Standardizing formats for dates, regions, and platforms.
   * Creating derived fields (e.g., engagement ratios, averages).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzing engagement trends across **platforms, content types, regions, hashtags, and time periods**.
   * Identifying **correlations and patterns** in audience interactions.

4. **SQL Queries & Insights Generation**

   * Writing and documenting SQL queries for data extraction and aggregation.
   * Summarizing findings based on analytical questions (**platforms, regions, content, hashtags, timing, top-performing posts**).

5. **Data Visualization**

   * Using **Tableau** to create intuitive visualizations (**bar charts, and line charts**).
   * Highlighting comparisons, trends, and patterns for better interpretation.

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Documenting methodology, queries, and cleaning steps.
   * Preparing a Github presentation summarizing overview, findings, insights, and recommendations.

### **Data Source**

* The dataset used in this project comes from **`nelson-1-project.social_media_trend.Vira_social_media_trend`** (BigQuery table).
* It contains structured records of **social media activity** across multiple platforms.

* **Key fields include**:

  * **Post\_Date** â€“ date of content posting
  * **Platform** â€“ social media platform (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc.)
  * **Region** â€“  location of audience engagement
  * **Content\_Type** â€“ type of content posted (Livestreams, video, Shorts, Post,Tweets etc.)
  * **Hashtags** â€“ hashtags used in the post
  * **Views, Likes, Shares, Comments** â€“ engagement metrics
  * **Engagement\_Level** â€“ classification of engagement intensity

* Data was analyzed using **SQL (BigQuery)** for extraction and aggregation, and **Tableau** for visualization and reporting.

---


---

### **Data Limitations**

While the dataset provides valuable insights, there are some limitations to consider:

1. **Data Completeness**

   * Some records were having **missing values** (e.g., incomplete hashtags, regions not specified,Date Not Specify as well).
   * Not all engagement metrics may be consistently available across platforms.

2. **Platform Representation**

   * Some platforms were having **more data points** than others, leading to possible bias in comparisons.

### **Project Objectives**

The main objective of this project is to **analyze social media engagement data** and provide actionable insights to help content creators, brands, and social media managers optimize their strategies for **maximum reach and engagement**.

Specifically, the project aims to:

1. **Identify top-performing platforms** in terms of average engagement per post.
2. **Examine content types** (e.g., Livestreams, videos, Shorts, Post e.t.c) that generate the highest views, likes, shares and Comments.
3. **Analyze regional engagement patterns** to determine where content resonates most strongly.
4. **Evaluate the impact of hashtags** on driving higher visibility and engagement.
5. **Discover time-based trends**, including months and specific days that yield higher engagement.
6. **Uncover common characteristics of top-performing posts**, such as themes, formats, or timing.
7. **Provide data-driven recommendations** for improving social media strategies across platforms.
